* for subscription based services eg. spotify, youtube red, pandora etc.

* "we" pay spotify $10/month on your behalf and you get to pay per minute, per hour, per year... any way you want

* charge extra for the subscription but give you more options on how you want to pay for it

* good for trying out subscriptions without having to pay $10 for 1 month. cancel the subscription any time and "we" tank the cost

* if you pay extra for the subscription by sticking with "our" service, you get extra points that you can share with other ppl. those ppl can try the service for free by using your points.

* you can use points for a certain service (eg. spotify) for any other service (eg. youtube red) at an increased cost
